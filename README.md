## 🚀 Overview

**ProTakeoff** is a cutting-edge, open-source **construction estimating** and **quantity takeoff (QTO)** tool designed to streamline the bidding process for contractors. Built with **Tauri**, **React**, and **Rust**, it combines the raw performance of a native desktop application with the flexibility of modern web technologies.

Most estimating software is expensive, cloud-dependent, and bloated. ProTakeoff is different. Whether you are a general contractor, flooring specialist, or a DIY enthusiast, ProTakeoff provides a **free** and **private** way to calculate materials, labor, and costs with pixel-perfect precision directly from your PDF plans.

## 💡 Why ProTakeoff?
- **💰 Free & Open Source:** Stop paying monthly subscriptions for basic takeoff tools.
- **⚡ Local-First Speed:** Powered by Rust and SQLite. Opens large blueprint PDFs instantly. No internet required.
- **🔒 Privacy Focused:** Your data stays on your machine. We don't mine your bid data.
- **🛠 Infinite Customization:** Define your own formulas (JavaScript syntax) and assemblies.

## ✨ Key Features

### 📐 Digital Quantity Takeoffs
Perform accurate measurements directly on your PDF blueprints.
- **Area & Square Footage:** Perfect for flooring, roofing, drywall, and concrete slabs.
- **Linear Footage:** Measure walls, trimming, curbing, and piping.
- **Item Counts:** Track fixtures, outlets, drains, and columns.
- **Canvas Tools:** Pan, zoom, and snap-to-lines for high-precision tracing.

### 💰 Professional Estimating & Bidding
Turn your takeoff measurements into professional bids.
- **Smart Assemblies:** Build complex items (e.g., a "Wall" assembly that automatically calculates studs, insulation, drywall, and paint based on one linear measurement).
- **Excel-like Formulas:** Use built-in math functions (`Math.ceil`, `Math.max`) to automate waste factors and pricing.
- **Material & Labor:** Separate material costs from labor hours for accurate profit analysis.

### 📄 PDF Plan Management
- **Visual Plan Organizer:** Drag-and-drop plan management.
- **Custom Scaling:** Calibrate each page to its specific scale (e.g., 1/4" = 1').
- **High-Performance Rendering:** Smooth scrolling even on 100+ page architectural sets.

### 📤 Reports & Export
- **Client Proposals:** Generate professional PDF quotes.
- **Excel/CSV Export:** Export raw data to connect with QuickBooks, Xero, or other accounting tools.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

ProTakeoff is engineered for performance using the "T3" (Tauri, TypeScript, Tailwind) architecture:

| Component | Technology | Why we chose it |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| **Frontend** | React 19, TypeScript, TailwindCSS | Type-safe, responsive, and modern UI. |
| **Backend** | Rust, Tauri v2 | Extremely small bundle size (<10MB) and native speed. |
| **Database** | SQLite | Robust local data storage without server latency. |
| **Build Tool** | Vite | Instant HMR and optimized production builds. |

## 📦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v18+)
- **Rust** (Stable)
- **npm** (the tracked lockfile and Tauri build commands use npm)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ilirkl/protakeoff-ai3.git
   cd protakeoff-ai3
   ```

   The URL above is the upstream project, not a guarantee of this fork's current branch. Use your configured fork remote when continuing local custom work.

2. **Install the tracked dependency graph and start development**
   ```bash
   npm ci
   npm run tauri dev
   ```
   For frontend-only development, use `npm run dev`. Build the frontend with `npm run build`.

September 20, 2026 documentation check: the version above matches `package.json` and `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`. Commands match the checked-in scripts; installation, build and application behavior were not revalidated in this pass. Preserve existing untracked licensing work and the alternate lockfile pending their own review.
